<h1 id="about me">About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ajay Nair and I am a freshman majoring in Computer Information Systems. I was born in Houston, but my parents were born in India. I love playing soccer and I occasionally go play with my cousins at George Bush Park. Back in high school, I always ended up skipping my lunch period just to go play soccer outside with the upperclassmen. I enjoy reading the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. My dad buys me the new book that comes out every November. Sometimes I just re-read the older books from the series just to take a break from the tedious Honors College reading assignments.</p>
